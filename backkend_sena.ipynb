      "To begin, let us consider the concept of force. Force, my dear, is a push or a pull that causes an object to change its motion. *writes on the blackboard*\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, imagine two objects, say, a planet and a moon, orbiting around each other. The force of gravity, my dear student, is the force that attracts these two objects towards each other. *points to the blackboard*\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do we quantify this force of gravity? Ah, that is where the magic happens! *excitedly*\n",
      "\n",
      "Newton's Law of Gravity states that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. *writes the equation on the blackboard*\n",

      "\n",
      "F = G \\* (m1 \\* m2) / r^2\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",

      "* m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects\n",
      "* r is the distance between the centers of the two objects\n",

      "Now, my dear student, can you see how this equation derives the force of gravity between two objects? *smiles*\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, there's more! *excitedly* The Law of Universal Gravitation, which is a corollary of Newton's Law of Gravity, states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. *writes the equation on the blackboard*\n",
